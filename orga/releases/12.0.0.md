# 12.0.0




# Unified the replication primitives and the GraphQL replication plugin 

Most of the GraphQL replication code has been replaced by using the replication primitives plugin internally.
This means many bugs and undefined behavior that was already fixed in the replication primitives, are now also fixed in the GraphQL replication.

Also the GraphQL replication now runs `push` in bulks. This means you either have to update your backend to accept bulk mutations, or set `push.batchSize: 1` and transform the array into a single document inside of the `push.queryBuilder()`.
