# Pouch find query planner

Everything in this folder is copied from the pouchdb-find query planner.
https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/packages/node_modules/pouchdb-find/src/adapters/local/find/query-planner.js

The method `planQuery()` is not exported by the pouchdb-find module.
TODO create a PR to pouchdb repo to export that method so we do not have to maintain copied code.
