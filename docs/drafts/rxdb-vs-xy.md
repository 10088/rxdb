# RxDB vs XY

Disclaimer: This text your are reading at the moment, is published in the [RxDB](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb) documentation. Everything I write here is heavily biased.

Instead I will just list up all the pros- and cons that I figured out when using these libraries, so that you do not have to find them out by yourself.
