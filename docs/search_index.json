 \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  A realtime Database for JavaScript Applications\n\n\n  RxDB (short for Reactive Database) is a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps, Progressive Web Apps and NodeJs.\n  Reactive means that you can not only query the current state, but subscribe to all state changes like the result of a query or even a single field of a document.\n  This is great for UI-based realtime applications in way that makes it easy to develop and also has great performance benefits. To replicate data between your clients and server, RxDB provides modules for realtime replication with any CouchDB compliant endpoint and also with custom GraphQL endpoints.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n    \n   -->\n\n\n\n\n  Core features\n\n\n\n\n  Realtime Queries\n\n\n\nIn addition to normal pull-based queries, RxDB is capable of having so called realtime queries. These do not only give you the results once but instead emit the new query results each time the state of your database changes.\nThe stream comes as simple RxJS Observable and works flawless together with your frontend framework.\n\n\ndb.heroes\n  .find({\n    sort: ['name']\n  })\n  .$ //  {\n    myDomElement.innerHTML = docs\n      .map(doc => '' + doc.name + '')\n      .join();\n  });\n\n\n\n  Replication\n\n\n\n  To synchronize data between your clients and your server, RxDB provides replication modules for CouchDB and GraphQL. So when your server changes data, your application will automatically stream that change to the client and updates its visual representation.\n\n\n\n\n  Multi-Window / Tab Support\n\n\n\n  When your application is opened in multiple windows or tabs at the same time, it can be tricky to synchronize actions between the open states. RxDB automatically broadcasts all changes between these tabs so you do not have to take any care of it.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Other features\n\n\n\n  Schema\n\n\n\n  RxDB is based on json-schema where the structure of documents is defined for each collection. This is useful when you develop in a team with multiple developers. It also provides information for RxDB to do performance optimizations. Also the schema is versionized and you can provide migration strategies to migrate the data which is already stored on the clients.\n\n\n\n  Encryption\n\n\n\n  RxDB comes with an encryption module where specific fields of a document can be stored encrypted. So when your clients device is stolen or hacked, you can be sure that sensitive data is not readable by third parties.\n\n\n\n  Key Compression\n\n\n  Saving data on a client can be tricky because you cannot predict how much storage capacity will be available. RxDB provides a key-compression module that compresses the stored json documents which saves about 40% of storage space.\n\n\n\n\n\n    If you are new to RxDB, you should continue reading the documentation here.\n\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Install\nnpm\nTo install the latest release of rxdb and its dependencies and save it to your package.json, run:\nnpm i rxdb --save\npeer-dependency\nYou also need to install the peer-dependency rxjs if you have not installed it before.\nnpm i rxjs --save\npolyfills\nRxDB is coded with es8 and transpiled to es5. This means you have to install polyfills to support older browsers. For example you can use the babel-polyfills with:\nnpm i @babel/polyfill --save\nIf you need polyfills, you have to import them in your code.\nimport '@babel/polyfill';\n\npolyfill global\nWhen you use RxDB with angular or other webpack based frameworks, you might get the error Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined. This is because pouchdb assumes a nodejs-specific global variable that is not added to browser runtimes by some bundlers.\nYou have to add them by your own, like we do here.\n(window as any).global = window;\n(window as any).process = {\n    env: { DEBUG: undefined },\n};\n\nProject Setup and Configuration\nIn the examples folder you can find CI tested projects for different frameworks and use cases, while in the /config folder base configuration files for Webpack, Rollup, Mocha, Karma, Typescript are exposed.\nConsult package.json for the versions of the packages supported.\nLatest\nIf you need the latest development state of RxDB, add it as git-dependency into your package.json.\n  \"dependencies\": {\n      \"rxdb\": \"git+https://git@github.com/pubkey/rxdb.git#commitHash\"\n  }\n\nReplace commitHash with the hash of the latest build-commit.\nImport\nTo import rxdb, add this to your javascript file:\nimport {\n  createRxDatabase,\n  RxDatabase\n  /* ... */\n} from 'rxdb';\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-database.html":{"url":"rx-database.html","title":"RxDatabase","keywords":"","body":"RxDatabase\nA RxDatabase-Object contains your collections and handles the synchronisation of change-events.\nCreation\nThe database is created by the asynchronous .create()-function of the main RxDB-module. It has the following parameters:\nimport { createRxDatabase, getRxStoragePouch } from 'rxdb';\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',           // \nname\nThe database-name is a string which uniquely identifies the database. When two RxDatabases have the same name and use the same storage-adapter, their data can be assumed as equal and they will share change-events between each other.\nDepending on the adapter this can also be used to define the storage-folder of your data.\nadapter\nRxDB uses adapters to define where the data is actually stored at. You can use different adapters depending on which environment your database runs in. This has the advantage that you can use the same RxDB code in different environments and just switch out the adapter.\nExample for browsers:\n\n// this adapter stores the data in indexeddb\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-idb'));\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb')\n});\n\n Check out the List of adapters for RxDB to learn which adapter you should use. \npassword\n(optional)\nIf you want to use encrypted fields in the collections of a database, you have to set a password for it. The password must be a string with at least 12 characters.\nmultiInstance\n(optional=true)\nWhen you create more than one instance of the same database in a single javascript-runtime, you should set multiInstance to true. This will enable the event-sharing between the two instances serverless. This should be set to false when you have single-instances like a single nodejs-process, a react-native-app, a cordova-app or a single-window electron-app.\neventReduce\n(optional=true)\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously. RxDB uses the EventReduce Algorithm to optimize observer or recurring queries.\nignoreDuplicate\n(optional=false)\nIf you create multiple RxDatabase-instances with the same name and same adapter, it's very likely that you have done something wrong.\nTo prevent this common mistake, RxDB will throw an error when you do this.\nIn some rare cases like unit-tests, you want to do this intentional by setting ignoreDuplicate to true.\nconst db1 = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('websql'),\n  ignoreDuplicate: true\n});\nconst db2 = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('websql'),\n  ignoreDuplicate: true // this create-call will not throw because you explicitly allow it\n});\n\npouchSettings\nYou can pass settings directly to the pouchdb database create options through this property. This settings will be added to all pouchdb-instances that are created for this database.\nFunctions\nObserve with $\nCalling this will return an rxjs-Observable which streams every change to data of this database.\nmyDb.$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\n\nexportJSON()\nUse this function to create a json-export from every piece of data in every collection of this database.

Read more\nserver()\nSpawns a couchdb-compatible server from the database. Read more\nwaitForLeadership()\nReturns a Promise which resolves when the RxDatabase becomes elected leader.\nrequestIdlePromise()\nReturns a promise which resolves when the database is in idle. This works similar to requestIdleCallback but tracks the idle-ness of the database instead of the CPU.\nUse this for semi-important tasks like cleanups which should not affect the speed of important tasks.\n\nmyDatabase.requestIdlePromise().then(() => {\n    // this will run at the moment the database has nothing else to do\n    myCollection.customCleanupFunction();\n});\n\n// with timeout\nmyDatabase.requestIdlePromise(1000 /* time in ms */).then(() => {\n    // this will run at the moment the database has nothing else to do\n    // or the timeout has passed\n    myCollection.customCleanupFunction();\n});\n\ndestroy()\nDestroys the databases object-instance.

There is a maximum of 5 skills per hero.\nAllows adding attachments and store them encrypted\n{\n  \"title\": \"hero schema\",\n  \"version\": 0,\n  \"description\": \"describes a simple hero\",\n  \"primaryKey\": \"name\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"color\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"healthpoints\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"minimum\": 0,\n          \"maximum\": 100\n      },\n      \"secret\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"birthyear\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"final\": true,\n          \"minimum\": 1900,\n          \"maximum\": 2050\n      },\n      \"skills\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"maxItems\": 5,\n          \"uniqueItems\": true,\n          \"items\": {\n              \"type\": \"object\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                  \"name\": {\n                      \"type\": \"string\"\n                  },\n                  \"damage\": {\n                      \"type\": \"number\"\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n      }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n      \"name\",\n      \"color\"\n  ],\n  \"encrypted\": [\"secret\"],\n  \"attachments\": {\n      \"encrypted\": true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nCreate a collection with the schema\nawait myDatabase.addCollections({\n    heroes: {\n        schema: myHeroSchema\n    }\n});\nconsole.dir(myDatabase.heroes.name);\n// heroes\n\nversion\nThe version field is a number, starting with 0.\nWhen the version is greater than 0, you have to provide the migrationStrategies to create a collection with this schema.\nprimaryKey\nThe primaryKey field contains the fieldname of the property that will be used as primary key for the whole collection.\nThe value of the primary key of the document must be a string, unique, final and is required.\ncomposite primary key\nYou can define a composite primary key which gets composed from multiple properties of the document data.\nconst mySchema = {\n  keyCompression: true, // set this to true, to enable the keyCompression\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with composite primary',\n  primaryKey: {\n      // where should the composed string be stored\n      key: 'id',\n      // fields that will be used to create the composed key\n      fields: [\n          'firstName',\n          'lastName'\n      ],\n      // separator which is used to concat the fields values.\n      separator: '|'\n  }\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      }\n  },\n  required: [\n    'id', \n    'firstName',\n    'lastName'\n  ]\n};\n\nYou can then find a document by using the relevant parts to create the composite primaryKey:\n\n// inserting with composite primary\nawait myRxCollection.insert({\n    // id, \nkeyCompression\nIf set to true (disabled by default), the documents will be stored in a compressed format which saves up to 40% disc space.\nFor compression the npm module jsonschema-key-compression is used.\nkeyCompression can only be set on the top-level of a schema.\nNotice: When you use keyCompression together with the graphql replication, you must ensure that direct non-RxDB writes to the remote database must also write compressed documents. Therefore it is not recommended to enable keyCompression for that use case.\nconst mySchema = {\n  keyCompression: true, // set this to true, to enable the keyCompression\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with compression',\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      }\n  },\n  required: [\n    'id', \n    'firstName',\n    'lastName'\n]\n};\n\nIndexes\nRxDB supports secondary indexes which are defined at the schema-level of the collection.\nIndex is only allowed on field types string, integer and number\nIndex-example\nconst schemaWithIndexes = {\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with indexes',\n  keyCompression: true,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      familyName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      creditCards: {\n          type: 'array',\n          items: {\n              type: 'object',\n              properties: {\n                    cvc: {\n                        type: 'number'\n                    }\n              }\n          }       \n      }\n  },\n  required: ['id'],\n  indexes: [\n    'firstName', // \nattachments\nTo use attachments in the collection, you have to add the attachments-attribute to the schema. See RxAttachment.\ndefault\nDefault values can only be defined for first-level fields.\nWhenever you insert a document or create a temporary-document, unset fields will be filled with default-values.\nconst schemaWithDefaultAge = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      age: {\n          type: 'integer',\n          default: 20       // \nfinal\nBy setting a field to final, you make sure it cannot be modified later. Final fields are always required.\nFinal fields cannot be observed because they will not change.\nAdvantages:\n\nWith final fields you can ensure that no-one accidentally modifies the data\nWhen you enable the query-change-detection, some performance-improvements are done\n\nconst schemaWithFinalAge = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      age: {\n          type: 'integer',\n          final: true\n      }\n  },\n  required: ['id']\n};\n\nencryption\nBy adding a field to the encrypted list, it will be stored encrypted inside of the data-store. The encryption will run internally, so when you get the RxDocument, you can access the unencrypted value.\nYou can set all fields to be encrypted, even nested objects. You can not run queries over encrypted fields.\nThe password used for encryption is set during database creation. See RxDatabase.\nconst schemaWithDefaultAge = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      secret: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n  },\n  required: ['id']\n  encrypted: ['secret']\n};\n\nNOTICE: Not everything within the jsonschema-spec is allowed\nThe schema is not only used to validate objects before they are written into the database, but also used to map getters to observe and populate single fieldnames, keycompression and other things. Therefore you can not use every schema which would be valid for the spec of json-schema.org.\nFor example, fieldnames must match the regex ^[a-zA-Z][[a-zA-Z0-9_]*]?[a-zA-Z0-9]$ and additionalProperties is always set to false. But don't worry, RxDB will instantly throw an error when you pass a invalid schema into it.\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-collection.html":{"url":"rx-collection.html","title":"RxCollection","keywords":"","body":"RxCollection\nA collection stores documents of the same type.\nCreating a Collection\nTo create one or more collections you need a RxDatabase object which has the .addCollections()-method. Every collection needs a collection name and a valid RxSchema. Other attributes are optional.\nconst myCollection = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  // key = collectionName\n  humans: {\n    schema: mySchema,\n    pouchSettings: {}, // (optional)\n    statics: {}, // (optional) ORM-functions for this collection\n    methods: {}, // (optional) ORM-functions for documents\n    attachments: {}, // (optional) ORM-functions for attachments\n    options: {}, // (optional) Custom parameters that might be used in plugins\n    migrationStrategies: {}, // (optional)\n    autoMigrate: true, // (optional)\n    cacheReplacementPolicy: function(){}, // (optional) custom cache replacement policy\n  },\n  // you can create multiple collections at once\n  otherHumans: {\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nname\nThe name uniquely identifies the collection and should be used to refind the collection in the database. Two different collections in the same database can never have the same name. Collection names must match the following regex: ^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$.\nschema\nThe schema defines how your data looks and how it should be handled. You can pass a RxSchema object or a simple javascript-object from which the schema will be generated.\npouchSettings\nYou can pass settings directly to the pouchdb database create options through this property.\nORM-functions\nWith the parameters statics, methods and attachments, you can define ORM-functions that are applied to each of these objects that belong to this collection. See ORM/DRM.\nMigration\nWith the parameters migrationStrategies and autoMigrate you can specify how migration between different schema-versions should be done. See Migration.\nGet a collection from the database\nTo get an existing collection from the database, call the collection name directly on the database:\n// newly created collection\nconst collections = await db.addCollections({\n  heroes: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\nconst collection2 = db.heroes;\nconsole.log(collections.heroes === collection2); //> true\n\nFunctions\nObserve $\nCalling this will return an rxjs-Observable which streams every change to data of this collection.\nmyCollection.$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\n\n// you can also observe single event-types with insert$ update$ remove$\nmyCollection.insert$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\nmyCollection.update$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\nmyCollection.remove$.subscribe(changeEvent => console.dir(changeEvent));\n\ninsert()\nUse this to insert new documents into the database. The collection will validate the schema and automatically encrypt any encrypted fields. Returns the new RxDocument.\nconst doc = await myCollection.insert({\n  name: 'foo',\n  lastname: 'bar'\n});\n\nbulkInsert()\nWhen you have to insert many documents at once, use bulk insert. This is much faster than calling .insert() multiple times.\nReturns an object with a success- and error-array.\nconst result = await myCollection.bulkInsert([{\n  name: 'foo1',\n  lastname: 'bar1'\n},\n{\n  name: 'foo2',\n  lastname: 'bar2'\n}]);\n\n// > {\n//   success: [RxDocument, RxDocument],\n//   error: []\n// }\n\nNOTICE: bulkInsert will not fail on update conflicts and you cannot expect that on failure the other documents are not inserted.\nbulkRemove()\nWhen you want to remove many documents at once, use bulk remove. Returns an object with a success- and error-array.\nconst result = await myCollection.bulkRemove([\n  'primary1',\n  'primary2'\n]);\n\n// > {\n//   success: [RxDocument, RxDocument],\n//   error: []\n// }\n\nnewDocument()\nSometimes it can be helpful to spawn and use documents before saving them into the database.\nThis is useful especially when you want to use the ORM methods or prefill values from form data.\nYou can create temporary documents by calling RxCollection.newDocument(initalData).\nconst tempDoc = myCollection.newDocument({\n    firstName: 'Bob'\n});\n\n// fill in data later\ntempDoc.lastName = 'Kelso';\ntempDoc.age = 77;\n\n// saving a temporary document will transform it to a standard RxDocument\nawait tempDoc.save();\n\nupsert()\nInserts the document if it does not exist within the collection, otherwise it will overwrite it. Returns the new or overwritten RxDocument.\nconst doc = await myCollection.upsert({\n  name: 'foo',\n  lastname: 'bar2'\n});\n\natomicUpsert()\nWhen you run many upsert operations on the same RxDocument in a very short timespan, you might get a 409 Conflict error.\nThis means that you tried to run a .upsert() on the document, while the previous upsert operation was still running.\nTo prevent these types of errors, you can run atomic upsert operations.\nThe behavior is similar to RxDocument.atomicUpdate.\nconst docData = {\n    name: 'Bob', // primary\n    lastName: 'Kelso'\n};\n\nmyCollection.upsert(docData);\nmyCollection.upsert(docData);\n// -> throws because of parrallel update to the same document\n\nmyCollection.atomicUpsert(docData);\nmyCollection.atomicUpsert(docData);\nmyCollection.atomicUpsert(docData);\n\n// wait until last upsert finished\nawait myCollection.atomicUpsert(docData);\n// -> works\n\nfind()\nTo find documents in your collection, use this method. See RxQuery.find().\n// find all that are older than 18\nconst olderDocuments = await myCollection\n    .find()\n    .where('age')\n    .gt(18)\n    .exec(); // execute\n\nfindOne()\nThis does basically what find() does, but it returns only a single document. You can pass a primary value to find a single document more easily.\nTo find documents in your collection, use this method. See RxQuery.find().\n// get document with name:foobar\nmyCollection.findOne({\n  selector: {\n    name: 'foo'\n  }\n}).exec().then(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\n// get document by primary, functionally identical to above query\nmyCollection.findOne('foo')\n  .exec().then(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\nfindByIds()\nNotice: This method is in beta and might be changed without notice.\nFind many documents by their id (primary value). This has a way better performance than running multiple findOne() or a find() with a big $or selector.\nReturns a Map where the primary key of the document is mapped to the document. Documents that do not exist or are deleted, will not be inside of the returned Map.\nconst ids = [\n  'alice',\n  'bob',\n  /* ... */\n];\nconst docsMap = await myCollection.findByIds(ids);\n\nconsole.dir(docsMap); // Map(2)\n\nNOTICE: The Map returned by findByIds is not guaranteed to return elements in the same order as the list of ids passed to it.\nfindByIds$()\nSame as findByIds() but returns an Observable that emits the Map each time a value of it has changed because of a database write.\nexportJSON()\nUse this function to create a json export from every document in the collection. You can pass true as a parameter to decrypt the encrypted data fields of your documents.\nmyCollection.exportJSON()\n  .then(json => console.dir(json));\n\n// decrypted dump\nmyCollection.exportJSON(true)\n  .then(json => console.dir(json));\n\nimportJSON()\nTo import the json dump into your collection, use this function.\n// import the dump to the database\nmyCollection.importJSON(json)\n  .then(() => console.log('done'));\n\nNote that importing will fire events for each inserted document.\nsyncCouchDB()\nThis method allows you to replicate data between other RxCollections, pouchdb instances or remote servers which support the couchdb-sync-protocol.\nFull documentation on how to use replication is here.\nsyncGraphQL()\nThis method allows you to replicate data between a RxCollection and a GraphQL endpoint.\nFull documentation on how to use replication is here.\nremove()\nRemoves all known data of the collection and its previous versions.\nThis removes the documents, the schemas, and older schemaVersions.\nawait myCollection.remove();\n// collection is now removed and can be re-created\n\ndestroy()\nDestroys the collection's object instance. This is to free up memory and stop all observings and replications.\nawait myCollection.destroy();\n\nisRxCollection\nReturns true if the given object is an instance of RxCollection. Returns false if not.\nconst is = isRxCollection(myObj);\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-document.html":{"url":"rx-document.html","title":"RxDocument","keywords":"","body":"RxDocument\nA document is a single object which is stored in a collection.

This assures that the client's data always matches your newest code-version.\nProviding strategies\nUpon creation of a collection, you have to provide migrationStrategies when your schema's version-number is greater than 0. To do this, you have to add an object to the migrationStrategies property where a function for every schema-version is assigned.

Count them, I will wait..\nSo if you would now inspect the traffic that theses open tabs produce, you can see that many of them send exact the same data over wire for every tab. No matter if the data is sent with an open websocket or by polling.\nUse-case-example\nImagine we have a website which displays the current temperature of the visitors location in various charts, numbers or heatmaps. To always display the live-data, the website opens a websocket to our API-Server which sends the current temperature every 10 seconds. Using the way most sites are currently build, we can now open it in 5 browser-tabs and it will open 5 websockets which send data 6*5=30 times per minute. This will not only waste the power of your clients device, but also wastes your api-servers resources by opening redundant connections.\nSolution\nThe solution to this redundancy is the usage of a leader-election-algorithm which makes sure that always exactly one tab is managing the remote-data-access. The managing tab is the elected leader and stays leader until it is closed. No matter how many tabs are opened or closed, there must be always exactly one leader.\nYou could now start implementing a messaging-system between your browser-tabs, hand out which one is leader, solve conflicts and reassign a new leader when the old one 'dies'.\nOr just use RxDB which does all these things for you.\nCode-example\nTo make it easy, here is an example where the temperature is pulled every ten seconds and saved to a collection. The pulling starts at the moment where the opened tab becomes the leader.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'weatherDB',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb'),\n  password: 'myPassword',\n  multiInstance: true\n});\nawait db.addCollections({\n  temperature: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\n\ndb.waitForLeadership()\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('Long lives the king!'); //  {\n      const temp = await fetch('https://example.com/api/temp/');\n      db.temperature.insert({\n          degrees: temp,\n          time: new Date().getTime()\n      });\n    }, 1000 * 10);\n  });\n\nLive-Example\nIn this example the leader is marked with the crown ♛\n\nTry it out\nRun the vanillaJS-example where the leading tab is marked with a crown on the top-right-corner.\nNotice\nThe leader election is implemented via the  broadcast-channel module.\nThe leader is elected between different processes on the same javascript-runtime. Like multiple tabs in the same browser or mupltiple NodeJs-processes on the same machine. It will not run between different replicated instances.\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-storage-lokijs.html":{"url":"rx-storage-lokijs.html","title":"RxStorage LokiJS","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage LokiJS (beta)\nInstead of using PouchDB as underlying storage engine, you can also use LokiJS.\nLokiJS has the main benefit of having a better performance. It can do this because it is an in-memory database that processes all data in memory and only saves to disc when the app is closed or an interval is reached.\nPros & Cons\nPros\n\nIt has a much faster initial load time because it loads all data from IndexedDB in a single request.\nQueries can run faster because all data is processed in memory\n\nCons\n\nIt does not support CouchDB replication, only GraphQL replication.\nIt does not support attachments.\nData can be lost when the JavaScript process is killed ungracefully like when the browser crashes or the power of the PC is terminated.\nAll data must fit into the memory.\n\nUsage\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/core';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageLoki\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/lokijs';\n\n// in the browser, we want to persist data in IndexedDB, so we use the indexeddb adapter.\nconst LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter = require('lokijs/src/incremental-indexeddb-adapter');\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n        adapter: new LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter(),\n        autoload: true,\n        autosave: true,\n        autosaveInterval: 500\n    })\n});\n\nAdapters\nLike PouchDB, LokiJS is based on adapters that determine where to store persistend data. For LokiJS there are adapters for IndexedDB, AWS S3, the NodeJS filesystem or NativeScript.\nFind more about the possible adapters at the LokiJS docs.\nMulti-Tab support\nWhen you use plain LokiJS, you cannot build an app that can be used in multiple browser tabs. The reason is that LokiJS loads data in bulk and then only regulary persists the in-memory state to disc. When opened in multiple tabs, it would happen that the LokiJS instances overwrite each other and data is lost.\nWith the RxDB LokiJS-plugin, this problem is fixed with the LeaderElection module. Between all open tabs, a leading tab is elected and only in this tab a database is created. All other tabs do not run queries against their own database, but instead call the leading tab to send and retrieve data. When the leading tab is closed, a new leader is elected that reopens the database and processes queries. You can disable this by setting multiInstance: false when creating the RxDatabase.\nKnown problems\nWhen you bundle the LokiJS Plugin with webpack, you might get the error Cannot find module \"fs\". This is because LokiJS uses a require('fs') statement that cannot work in the browser.\nYou can fix that by telling webpack to not resolve the fs module with the following block in your webpack config:\n// in your webpack.config.js\n{\n    /* ... */\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            fs: false\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"replication-couchdb.html":{"url":"replication-couchdb.html","title":"Replication CouchDB","keywords":"","body":"CouchDB Replication\nWith the CouchDB replication you can replicate data in both directions with any CouchDB- or PouchDB compliant endpoint.\nIt works with remote endpoints and also with local pouchdb instances or RxCollection that is created with the pouchdb storage.\nRx.Collection.syncCouchDB()\nTo replicate the collection with another instance, use RxCollection.syncCouchDB().\nIt basically does the same as pouchdb-sync but also adds event-handlers to make sure that change-events will be recognized in the internal event-stream.\n\n// you need these plugins to sync\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-http')); // enable syncing over http (remote database)\n\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncCouchDB({\n    remote: 'http://localhost:10102/db/', // remote database.

This limitation is at the level of browser per tab per domain (some browser, especially older ones, might have a different limit, see here).\nSince this limitation is at the browser level there are several solutions:\n\nUse a proxy (ex: HAProxy) between the browser and CouchDB and configure it to use HTTP2.0, since HTTP2.0 doesn't have this limitation (RECOMMENDED)\nUse only a single database for all entities and set a \"type\" field for each of the documents\nCreate multiple subdomains for CouchDB and use a max of 6 active synchronizations (or less) for each\n\nRxReplicationState\nThe method RxCollection.syncCouchDB() returns a RxReplicationState which can be used to observe events via rxjs-observables and to cancel the replication.\nchange$\nEmits the change-events every time some documents get replicated.\nreplicationState.change$.subscribe(change => console.dir(change));\n\ndocs$\nEmits each replicated document-data.\nreplicationState.docs$.subscribe(docData => console.dir(docData));\n\ndenied$\nEmits when a document failed to replicate (e.g. due to permissions).\nreplicationState.denied$.subscribe(docData => console.dir(docData));\n\nactive$\nEmits true or false depending if the replication is transmitting data.

You can solve this be changing the batches configuration.const replicationState = await myCollection.syncCouchDB({\nremote: 'http://...',\noptions: {\n    retry: true,\n    batch_size: 1, // only transfer one document per batch\n    batches_limit: 1 // only one batch in parrallel\n}\n});\n\n\nWhen you replicate attachments bigger then 1mb you might cause the replication to stuck.

This allows you to replicate data from the server into the client-side database and then query and modify it in realtime.\nWhen the user is offline, you still can use the data and later sync it with the server when the client is online again like in other Offline-First systems.\nComparison to Couchdb-Sync\nPros:\n\nThe GraphQL-replication is faster and needs less resources.\nYou do not need a couchdb-compliant endpoint, only a GraphQL-endpoint.\n\nCons:\n\nYou can not replicate multiple databases with each other.\nIt is assumed that the GraphQL-server is the single source of truth.\nYou have to setup things at the server side while with couchdb-sync you only have to start a server.\nThe GraphQL replication does not support the replication of attachments.\n\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\nUsage\nData Design\nTo use the GraphQL-replication you first have to ensure that your data is sortable by update time and your documents never get deleted, only have a deleted-flag set.\nFor example if your documents look like this,\n{\n    \"id\": \"foobar\",\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Wilson\",\n    \"updatedAt\": 1564783474,\n    \"deleted\": false\n}\n\nThen your data is always sortable by updatedAt. This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes, it can send the latest updatedAt to the GraphQL-endpoint and then recieve all newer documents.\nDeleted documents still exist but have deleted: true set. This ensures that when RxDB fetches new documents, even the deleted documents are send back and can be known at the client-side.\nGraphQL Server\nAt the server-side, there must exist an endpoint which returns newer rows when the last replicated document is used as input. For example lets say you create a Query feedForRxDBReplication which returns a list of newer documents, related to the given one, sorted by updatedAt.\nFor the push-replication, you also need a modifier which lets RxDB update data with a changed document as input.\ninput HumanInput {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Int!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Human {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Int!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Query {\n    feedForRxDBReplication(lastId: String!, minUpdatedAt: Int!, limit: Int!): [Human!]!\n}\ntype Mutation {\n    setHuman(human: HumanInput): Human\n}\n\nThe resolver would then look like:\nconst rootValue = {\n    feedForRxDBReplication: args => {\n        // sorted by updatedAt first and the id as second\n        const sortedDocuments = documents.sort((a, b) => {\n            if (a.updatedAt > b.updatedAt) return 1;\n            if (a.updatedAt  b.id) return 1;\n                if (a.id  {\n            if (doc.updatedAt  args.minUpdatedAt) return true;\n            if (doc.updatedAt === args.minUpdatedAt) {\n                // if updatedAt is equal, compare by id\n                if (doc.id > args.lastId) return true;\n                else return false;\n            }\n        });\n\n        // only return some documents in one batch\n        const limited = filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId.slice(0, args.limit);\n\n        return limited;\n    },\n    // a modifier that updates the state on the server\n    setHuman: args => {\n        const doc = args.human;\n        documents = documents.filter(d => d.id !== doc.id);\n        doc.updatedAt = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000);\n        documents.push(doc);\n        return doc;\n    },\n}\n\nRxDB Client\nImport the plugin\nThe graphql-replication is not part of the default-build of RxDB. You have to import the plugin before you can use it.\nimport { RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-graphql';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin);\n\nPull replication\nFor the pull-replication, you first need a pullQueryBuilder. This is a function that gets the last replicated document as input and returns an object with a GraphQL-query and its variables (or a promise that resolves to the same object). RxDB will use the query builder to construct what is later send to the GraphQL endpoint.\nconst pullQueryBuilder = doc => {\n    if (!doc) {\n        // the first pull does not have a start-document\n        doc = {\n            id: '',\n            updatedAt: 0\n        };\n    }\n    const query = `{\n        feedForRxDBReplication(lastId: \"${doc.name}\", minUpdatedAt: ${doc.updatedAt}, limit: 5) {\n            id,\n            name,\n            lastName,\n            updatedAt\n            deleted\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {}\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the pull-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql', // url to the GraphQL endpoint\n    pull: {\n        queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        modifier: doc => doc // (optional) modifies all pulled documents before they are handeled by RxDB. Returning null will skip the document.\n        dataPath: undefined // (optional) specifies the object path to access the document(s). Otherwise, the first result of the response data is used.\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true // if this is true, rxdb will watch for ongoing changes and sync them, when false, a one-time-replication will be done\n});\n\nPush replication\nFor the push-replication, you also need a queryBuilder. Here, the builder recieves a changed document as input which has to be send to the server. It also returns a GraphQL-Query and its data.\nconst pushQueryBuilder = doc => {\n    const query = `\n        mutation CreateHuman($human: HumanInput) {\n            setHuman(human: $human) {\n                id,\n                updatedAt,\n                deleted\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n    const variables = {\n        human: doc\n    };\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the push-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql', // url to the GraphQL endpoint\n    push: {\n        queryBuilder: pushQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        batchSize: 5, // (optional) amount of documents that will pulled out of the storage at once. This does not affect how many documents are send to the server in a single request.\n        modifier: d => d // (optional) modifies all pushed documents before they are send to the GraphQL endpoint. Returning null will skip the document.\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true // if this is true, rxdb will watch for ongoing changes and sync them\n});\n\nOf course you can start the push- and the pull-replication in a single call to myCollection.syncGraphQL().\nUsing subscriptions\nFor the pull-replication, RxDB will run the pull-function every 10 seconds to fetch new documents from the server.\nThis means that when a change happens on the server, RxDB will, in the worst case, take 10 seconds until the changes is replicated to the client.\nTo improve this, it is recommended to setup GraphQL Subscriptions which will trigger the replication cycle when a change happens on the server.\nimport {\n    SubscriptionClient\n} from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';\n\n// start the replication\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql',\n    pull: {\n        pullQueryBuilder,\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true,\n    /**\n     * Because we use the subscriptions as notifiers,\n     * we can set the liveInterval to a very height value.\n     */\n    liveInterval: 60 * 1000\n});\n\n\n// setup the subscription client\nconst wsClient = new SubscriptionClient(\n    'ws://example.com/subscriptions', {\n        reconnect: true,\n    }\n);\n\nconst query = `subscription onHumanChanged {\n    humanChanged {\n        id\n    }\n}`;\nconst changeObservable = wsClient.request({ query });\n// subscribe to all events\nchangeObservable.subscribe({\n    next(data) {\n        /**\n         * When a change happens, call .run() on the replicationState.\n         * This will trigger the pull-handler and download changes from the server.\n         */\n        replicationState.run();\n    }\n});\n\nHelper Functions (beta)\nRxDB provides the helper functions graphQLSchemaFromRxSchema(), pullQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() and pushQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() that can be used to generate the GraphQL Schema from the RxJsonSchema. To learn how to use them, please inspect the GraphQL Example.\nConflict Resolution\nRxDB assumes that the Conflict Resolution will happen on the server side.\nWhen the clients sends a document to the server which causes a conflict, this has to be resolved there and then the resulting document can be synced down to RxDB. While CouchDB uses revision-flags for conflicts, you can use any logic like relying on the updatedAt date or other flags.\nRxGraphQLReplicationState\nWhen you call myCollection.syncGraphQL() it returns a RxGraphQLReplicationState which can be used to subscribe to events, for debugging or other functions.\n.isStopped()\nReturns true if the replication is stopped. This can be if a non-live replication is finished or a replication got canceled.\nreplicationState.isStopped(); // true/false\n\n.setHeaders()\nChanges the headers for the replication after it has been set up.\nreplicationState.setHeaders({\n    Authorization: `...`\n});\n\n.awaitInitialReplication()\nReturns a Promise that is resolved as soon as the initial replication is done.\nawait replicationState.awaitInitialReplication();\nconsole.log('initial sync done, client data is equal to server data');\n\n.run()\nTriggers a replication cycle with the server. This is done automatically if the data changes on the client side or the pull-interval is called. This returns a Promise which is resolved when the run-cycle is done. Calling run() many times is no problem because it is queued internally.\nawait replicationState.run();\n\n.cancel()\nCancels the replication. This is done autmatically if the RxCollection or it's RxDatabase is destroyed.\nawait replicationState.cancel();\n\n.received$\nAn Observable that emits each document that is received from the endpoint.\n.send$\nAn Observable that emits each document that is send to the endpoint.\n.error$\nAn Observable that emits each error that happens during the replication. Use this if something does not work for debugging. RxDB will handle network errors automatically, other errors must be solved by the developer.\nreplicationState.error$.subscribe(error => {\n    console.log('something was wrong');\n    console.dir(error);\n});\n\n.canceled$\nAn Observable that emits true when the replication is canceled, false if not.\n.active$\nAn Observable that emits true when the replication is doing something, false when not.\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"replication.html":{"url":"replication.html","title":"Replication Primitives","keywords":"","body":"Replication primitives (beta)\nWith the replication primitives plugin, you can build a realtime replication based on any transport layer like REST, WebRTC or websockets.\nTrade offs\n\nThis plugin is made to do a many-to-one replication like you would do when you replicate many clients with one backend server.

This makes sense especially when RxDB is used in UI-applications where people move for- and backwards on different routes or pages and the same queries are used many times. Because of the event-reduce algorithm cached queries are even valuable for optimization, when changes to the database occur between now and the last execution.\nCache Replacement Policy\nTo not let RxDB fill up all the memory, a cache replacement policy is defined that clears up the cached queries. This is implemented as a function which runs regularly, depending on when queries are created and the database is idle. The default policy should be good enough for most use cases but defining custom ones can also make sense.\nThe default policy\nThe default policy starts cleaning up queries depending on how much queries are in the cache and how much document data they contain.\n\nIt will never uncache queries that have subscribers to their results\nIt tries to always have less then 100 queries without subscriptions in the cache.\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have never executed and are older then 30 seconds\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have not been used for longer time\n\nOther references to queries\nWith JavaScript, it is not possible to count references to variables. Therefore it might happen that an uncached RxQuery is still referenced by the users code and used to get results. This should never be a problem, uncached queries must still work. Creating the same query again however, will result in having two RxQuery instances instead of one.\nUsing a custom policy\nA cache replacement policy is a normal JavaScript function according to the type RxCacheReplacementPolicy.\nIt gets the RxCollection as first parameter and the QueryCache as second. Then it itterates over the cached RxQuery instances and uncaches the desired ones with uncacheRxQuery(rxQuery). When you create your custom policy, you should have a look at the default.\nTo apply a custom policy to a RxCollection, add the function as attribute cacheReplacementPolicy.\nconst collection = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n    humans: {\n        schema: mySchema,\n        cacheReplacementPolicy: function(){ /* ... */ }\n    }\n});\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-local-document.html":{"url":"rx-local-document.html","title":"LocalDocuments","keywords":"","body":"Local Documents\nLocal documents are a special class of documents which are used to store local metadata.\nThey come in handy when you want to store settings or additional data next to your documents.\n\nLocal Documents can exist on RxDatabase or RxCollection\nLocal Document do not have to match the collections schema\nLocal Documents do not get replicated\nLocal Documents will not be found on queries\nLocal Documents can not have attachments\nLocal Documents will not get handled by the data-migration\n\ninsertLocal()\nCreates a local document for the database or collection.

This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.\n\nOffline first is not about having no internet connection\n\nWhile in the past, internet connection was an unstable, things are changing especially for mobile devices.\nMobile networks become better and having no internet becomes less common even in remote locations.\nSo if we did not care about offline first applications in the past, why should we even care now?\nIn the following I will point out why offline first applications are better, not because they support offline usage, but because of other reasons.\nUX is better without loading spinners\nIn 'normal' web applications, most user interactions like fetching, saving or deleting data, correspond to a request to the backend server. This means that each of these interactions require the user to await the unknown latency to and from a remote server while looking at a loading spinner.\nIn offline-first apps, the operations go directly against the local storage which happens almost instantly. There is no perceptible loading time and so it is not even necessary to implement a loading spinner at all. As soon as the user clicks, the UI represents the new state as if it was already changed in the backend.\n\n  \n\n\nMulti-tab usage just works\nMany, even big websites like amazon, reddit and stack overflow do not handle multi tab usage correctly. When a user has multiple tabs of the website open and does a login on one of these tabs, the state does not change on the other tabs.\nOn offline first applications, there is always exactly one state of the data across all tabs. Offline first databases (like RxDB) store the data inside of IndexedDb and share the state between all tabs of the same origin.\n\n  \n\n\nLatency is more important than bandwidth\nIn the past, often the bandwidth was the limiting factor on determining the loading time of an application.\nBut while bandwidth has improved over the years, latency became the limiting factor.\nYou can always increase the bandwidth by setting up more cables or sending more Starlink satellites to space.\nBut reducing the latency is not so easy. It is defined by the physical properties of the transfer medium, the speed of light and the distance to the server. All of these three are hard to optimize.\nOffline first application benefit from that because sending the initial state to the client can be done much faster with more bandwidth. And once the data is there, we do no longer have to care about the latency to the backend server.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRealtime comes for free\nMost websites lie to their users. They do not lie because they display wrong data, but because they display old data that was loaded from the backend at the time the user opened the site.\nTo overcome this, you could build a realtime website where you create a websocket that streams updates from the backend to the client. This means work. Your client needs to tell the server which page is currently opened and which updates the client is interested to. Then the server can push updates over the websocket and you can update the UI accordingly.\nWith offline first applications, you already have a realtime replication with the backend. Most offline first databases provide some concept of changestream or data subscriptions and with RxDB you can even directly subscribe to query results or single fields of documents. This makes it easy to have an always updated UI whenever data on the backend changes.\n\n  \n\n\n\nScales with data size, not with the amount of user interaction\nOn normal applications, each user interaction can result in multiple requests to the backend server which increase its load.\nThe more users interact with your application, the more backend resources you have to provide.\nOffline first applications do not scale up with the amount of user actions but instead they scale up with the amount of data.\nOnce that data is transferred to the client, the user can do as many interactions with it as required without connecting to the server.\nModern apps have longer runtimes\nIn the past you used websites only for a short time. You open it, perform some action and then close it again. This made the first load time the important metric when evaluating page speed.\nToday web applications have changed and with it the way we use them. Single page applications are opened once and then used over the whole day. Chat apps, email clients, PWAs and hybrid apps. All of these were made to have long runtimes.\nThis makes the time for user interactions more important than the initial loading time. Offline first applications benefit from that because there is often no loading time on user actions while loading the initial state to the client is not that relevant.\nYou might not need REST\nOn normal web applications, you make different requests for each kind of data interaction.\nFor that you have to define a swagger route, implement a route handler on the backend and create some client code to send or fetch data from that route. The more complex your application becomes, the more REST routes you have to maintain and implement.\nWith offline first apps, you have a way to hack around all this cumbersome work. You just replicate the whole state from the server to the client. The replication does not only run once, you have a realtime replication and all changes at one side are automatically there on the other side. On the client, you can access every piece of state with a simple database query.\nWhile this of course only works for amounts of data that the client can load and store, it makes implementing prototypes and simple apps much faster.\nYou might not need Redux\nData is hard, especially for UI applications where many things can happen at the same time.\nThe user is clicking around. Stuff is loaded from the server. All of these things interact with the global state of the app.\nTo manage this complexity it is common to use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. With them, you write all this lasagna code to wrap the mutation of data and to make the UI react to all these changes.\nOn offline first apps, your global state is already there in a single place stored inside of the local database.\nYou do not have to care whether this data came from the UI, another tab, the backend or another device of the same user. You can just make writes to the database and fetch data out of it.\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue with the Downsides of Offline First\n"},"downsides-of-offline-first.html":{"url":"downsides-of-offline-first.html","title":"Downsides of Offline First","keywords":"","body":"Downsides of Offline First\nSo you have read all theses things about how the offline first paradigm makes it easy to create realtime web applications that even work when the user has no internet connection.\nBut there is no free lunch. The offline first paradigm is not the perfect approach for all kinds of apps.\n\nYou fully understood a technology when you know when not to use it\n\nIn the following I will point out the limitations you need to know before you decide to use RxDB or even before you decide to create an offline first application.\nIt only works with small datasets\nMaking data available offline means it must be loaded from the server and then stored at the clients device.\nYou need to load the full dataset on the first pageload and on every ongoing load you need to download the new changes to that set.\nWhile in theory you could download in infinite amount of data, in practice you have a limit how long the user can wait before having an up-to-date state.\nYou want to display chat messages like Whatsapp? No problem. Syncing all the messages a user could write, can be done with a few HTTP requests.\nWant to make a tool that displays server logs? Good luck downloading terabytes of data to the client just to search for a single string. This will not work.\nBesides the network usage, there is another limit for the size of your data.\nIn browsers you have some options for storage: Cookies, Localstorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.\nBecause Cookies and Localstorage is slow and WebSQL is deprecated, you will use IndexedDB.\nThe limit of how much data you can store in IndexedDB depends on two factors: Which browser is used and how much disc space is left on the device. You can assume that at least a couple of hundred megabytes are available at least. The maximum is potentially hundreds of gigabytes or more, but the browser implementations vary. Chrome allows the browser to use up to 60% of the total disc space per origin. Firefox allows up to 50%. But on safari you can only store up to 1GB and the browser will prompt the user on each additional 200MB increment.\nThe problem is, that you have no chance to really predict how much data can be stored. So you have to make assumptions that are hopefully true for all of your users. Also, you have no way to increase that space like you would add another hard drive to your backend server. Once your clients reach the limit, you likely have to rewrite big parts of your applications.\nBrowser storage is not really persistent\nWhen data is stored inside IndexedDB or one of the other storage APIs, it cannot be trusted to stay there forever.\nApple for example deletes the data when the website was not used in the last 7 days. The other browsers also have logic to clean up the stored data, and in the end the user itself could be the one that deletes the browers local data.\nThe most common way to handle this, is to replicate everything from the backend to the client again.\nOf course, this does not work for state that is not stored at the backend. So if you assume you can store the users private data inside the browser in a secure way, you are wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nThere can be conflicts\nImagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.\n\nThe default in many offline first databases is a deterministic conflict resolution strategy. Both conflicting versions of the document are kept in the storage and when you query for the document, a winner is determined by comparing the hashes of the document and only the winning document is returned. Because the comparison is deterministic, all clients and servers will always pick the same winner. This kind of resolution only works when it is not that important that one of the document changes gets dropped. Because conflicts are rare, this might be a viable solution for some use cases.\n\nA better resolution can be applied by listening to the changestream of the database. The changestream emits an event each time a write happens to the database. The event contains information about the written document and also a flag if there is a conflicting version. For each event with a conflict, you fetch all versions for that document and create a new document that contains the winning state. With that you can implement pretty complex conflict resolution strategies, but you have to manually code it for each collection of documents.\n\nInstead of the solving conflict once at every client, it can be made a bit easier by solely relying on the backend. This can be done when all of your clients replicate with the same single backend server. With RxDB's Graphql Replication each client side change is sent to the server where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients.\n\nSometimes there is no way to solve a conflict with code. If your users edit text based documents or images, often only the user's themself can decide how the winning revision has to look. For these cases, you have to implement complex UI parts where the users can inspect the conflict and manage its resolution.\n\nYou do not have to handle conflicts if they cannot happen in the first place. You can achieve that by designing a write only database where existing documents cannot be touched. Instead of storing the current state in a single document, you store all the events that lead to the current state. Sometimes called the \"everything is a delta\" strategy, others would call it Event Sourcing. Like an accountant that does not need an eraser, you append all changes and afterwards aggregate the current state at the client.\n// create one new document for each change to the users balance\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 100} // balance increased by $100\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: -50} // balance decreased by $50\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 200} // balance increased by $200\n\n\nThere is this thing called conflict-free replicated data type, short CRDT. Using a CRDT library like automerge will magically solve all of your conflict problems. Until you use it in production where you observe that implementing CRDTs has basically the same complexity as implementing conflict resolution strategies.\n\n\nRealtime is a lie\nSo you replicate stuff between the clients and your backend. Each change on one side directly changes the state of the other sides in realtime. But this \"realtime\" is not the same as in realtime computing. In the offline first world, the word realtime was introduced by firebase and is more meant as a marketing slogan than a technical description.\nThere is an internet between your backend and your clients and everything you do on one machine takes at least once the latency until it can affect anything on the other machines. You have to keep this in mind when you develop anything where the timing is important, like a multiplayer game or a stock trading app.\nEven when you run a query against the local database, there is no \"real\" realtime.\nClient side databases run on JavaScript and JavaScript runs on a single CPU that might be partially blocked because the user is running some background processes. So you can never guarantee a response deadline which violates the time constraint of realtime computing.\n\n  \n\n\nEventual consistency\nAn offline first app does not have a single source of truth. There is a source on the backend, one on the own client, and also each other client has its own definition of truth. At the moment your user starts the app, the local state is hopefully already replicated with the backend and all other clients. But this does not have to be true, the states can have converged and you have to plan for that.\nThe user could update a document based on wrong assumptions because it was not fully replicated at that point in time because the user is offline. A good way to handle this problem is to show the replication state in the UI and tell the user when the replication is running, stopped, paused or finished.\nAnd some data is just too important to be \"eventual consistent\". Create a wire transfer in your online banking app while you are offline. You keep the smartphone laying at your night desk and when you use again in the next morning, it goes online and replicates the transaction. No thank you, do not use offline first for these kind of things, or at least you have to display the replication state of each document in the UI.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPermissions and authentication\nEvery offline first app that goes beyond a prototype, does likely not have the same global state for all of its users. Each user has a different set of documents that are allowed to be replicated or seen by the user. So you need some kind of authentication and permission handling to divide the documents.\nThe easy way is to just create one database for each user on the backend and only allow to replicate that one. Creating that many databases is not really a problem with for example CouchDB, and it makes permission handling easy.\nBut as soon as you want to query all of your data in the backend, it will bite back. Your data is not at a single place, it is distributed between all of the user specific databases. This becomes even more complex as soon as you store information together with the documents that is not allowed to be seen by outsiders. You not only have to decide which documents to replicate, but also which fields of them.\nSo what you really want is a single datastore in the backend and then replicate only the allowed document parts to each of the users.\nThis always requires you to implement your custom replication endpoint like what you do with RxDBs GraphQL Replication.\nYou have to migrate the client database\nWhile developing your app, sooner or later you want to change the data layout. You want to add some new fields to documents or change the format of them. So you have to update the database schema and also migrate the stored documents.\nWith 'normal' applications, this is already hard enough and often dangerous. You wait until midnight, stop the webserver, make a database backup, deploy the new schema and then you hope that nothing goes wrong while it updates that many documents.\nWith offline first applications, it is even more fun. You do not only have to migrate your local backend database, you also have to provide a migration strategy for all of these client databases out there. And you also cannot migrate everything at the same time. The clients can only migrate when the new code was updated from the appstore or the user visited your website again. This could be today or in a few weeks.\nPerformance is not native\nWhen you create a web based offline first app, you cannot store data directly on the users filesystem. In fact there are many layers between your JavaScript code and the filesystem of the operation system. Let's say you insert a document in RxDB:\n\nYou call the RxDB API to validate and store the data\nRxDB calls the underlying RxStorage, which is PouchDB for most cases\nPouchdb calls its underlying storage adapter\nThe storage adapter calls IndexedDB\nThe browser runs its internal handling of the IndexedDB API\nIn most browsers IndexedDB is implemented on top of SQLite\nSQLite calls the OS to store the data in the filesystem\n\nAll these layers are abstractions. They are not build for exactly that one use case, so you lose some performance to tunnel the data through the layer itself, and you also lose some performance because the abstraction does not exactly provide the functions that are needed by the layer above and it will overfetch data.\nYou will not find a benchmark comparison between how many transactions per second you can run on the browser compared to a server based database. Because it makes no sense to compare them. Browsers are slower, JavaScript is slower.\n\nIs it fast enough?\n\nWhat you really care about is \"Is it fast enough?\". For most use cases, the answer is yes. Offline first apps are UI based and you do not need to process a million transactions per second, because your user will not click the save button that often. \"Fast enough\" means that the data is processed in under 16 milliseconds so that you can render the updated UI in the next frame. This is of course not true for all use cases, so you better think about the performance limit before starting with the implementation.\nNothing is predictable\nYou have a PostgreSQL database and run a query over 1000ths of rows, which takes 200 milliseconds. Works great, so you now want to do something similar at the client device in your offline first app. How long does it take? You cannot know because people have different devices, and even equal devices have different things running in the background that slow the CPUs. So you cannot predict performance and as described above, you cannot even predict the storage limit. So if your app does heavy data analytics, you might better run everything on the backend and just send the results to the client.\nThere is no relational data\nI started creating RxDB many years ago and while still maintaining it, I often worked with all these other offline first databases out there. RxDB and all of these other ones, are based on some kind of document databases similar to NoSQL. Often people want to have a relational database like the SQL one they use at the backend. \nSo why are there no real relations in offline first databases? I could answer with these arguments like how JavaScript works better with document based data, how performance is better when having no joins or even how NoSQL queries are more composable. But the truth is, everything is NoSQL because it makes replication easy. An SQL query that mutates data in different tables based on some selects and joins, cannot be partially replicated without breaking the client. You have foreign keys that point to other rows and if these rows are not replicated yet, you have a problem. To implement a robust replication protocol for relational data, you need some stuff like a reliable atomic clock and you have to block queries over multiple tables while a transaction replicated. Watch this guy implementing offline first replication on top of SQLite or read this discussion about implementing offline first in supabase.\nSo creating replication for an SQL offline first database is way more work then just adding some network protocols on top of PostgreSQL. It might not even be possible for clients that have no reliable clock.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue with Why it has to be NoSQL\n"},"why-nosql.html":{"url":"why-nosql.html","title":"Why NoSQL","keywords":"","body":"Why it has to be NoSQL\nRxDB, a client side, offline first, JavaScript database, is now several years old.\nOften new users appear in the chat and ask for that one simple feature:\nThey want to store and query relational data.\n\nSo why not just implement SQL?\n\nAll these client databases out there have on some kind\nof document-based, NoSQL like, storage engine. PouchDB, Firebase, AWS Datastore, RethinkDB's Horizon, Meteor's Minimongo, Parse, Realm. They all do not have real relational data.\nThey might have some kind of weak relational foreign keys like the RxDB Population\nor the relational models of AWS Datastore.\nBut these relations are weak. The foreign keys are not enforced to be valid like in PostgreSQL, and you cannot query\nthe rows with complex subqueries over different tables or collections and then make mutations based on the result.\nThere must be a reason for that. In fact, there are multiple of them and in the following I want to show you why you can neither have, nor want real relational data when you have a client-side database with replication.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRelational queries in NoSQL\nWhat most people want from a relational database, is to run queries over multiple tables.\nSome people think that they cannot do that with NoSQL, so let me explain.\nLet's say you have two tables with customers and cities where each city has an id and each customer has a city_id. You want to get every customer that resides in Tokyo. With SQL, you would use a query like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM city\nWHERE city.name = 'Tokyo'\nLEFT JOIN customer ON customer.city_id = city.id;\n\nWith NoSQL you can just do the same, but you have to write it manually:\nconst cityDocument = await db.cities.findOne().where('name').equals('Tokyo').exec();\nconst customerDocuments = await db.customers.find().where('city_id').equals(cityDocument.id).exec();\n\nSo what are the differences? The SQL version would run faster on a remote database server because it would aggregate all data there and return only the customers as result set. But when you have a local database, it is not really a difference. Querying the two tables by hand would have about the same performance as a JavaScript implementation of SQL that is running locally.\nThe main benefit from using SQL is, that the SQL query runs inside of a single transaction. When a change to one of our two tables happens, while our query runs, the SQL database will ensure that the write does not affect the result of the query. This could happen with NoSQL, while you retrieve the city document, the customer table gets changed and your result is not correct for the dataset that was there when you started the querying. As a workarround, you could observe the database for changes and if a change happened in between, you have to re-run everything.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReliable replication\nIn an offline first app, your data is replicated from your backend servers to your users and you want it to be reliable.\nThe replication is reliable when, no matter what happens, every online client is able to run a replication\nand end up with the exact same database state as any other client.\nImplementing a reliable replication protocol is hard because of the circumstances of your app:\n\nYour users have unknown devices.\nThey have an unknown internet speed.\nThey can go offline or online at any time.\nClients can be offline for a several days with un-synced changes.\nYou can have many users at the same time.\nThe users can do many database writes at the same time to the same entities.\n\nNow lets say you have a SQL database and one of your users, called Alice, runs a query that mutates some rows, based on a condition.\n# mark all items out of stock as inStock=FALSE\nUPDATE\n  Table_A\nSET\n  Table_A.inStock = FALSE\nFROM\n  Table_A\nWHERE\n  Table_A.amountInStock = 0\n\nAt first, the query runs on the local database of Alice and everything is fine.\nBut at the same time Bob, the other client, updates a row and sets amountInStock from 0 to 1.\nNow Bob's client replicates the changes from Alice and runs them. Bob will end up with a different database state then Alice because on one of the rows, the WHERE condition was not met. This is not what we want, so our replication protocol should be able to fix it. For that it has to reduce all mutations into a deterministic state.\nLet me loosely describe how \"many\" SQL replications work:\nInstead of just running all replicated queries, we remember a list of all past queries. When a new query comes in that happened before our last query, we roll back the previous queries, run the new query, and then re-execute our own queries on top of that. For that to work, all queries need a timestamp so we can order them correctly. But you cannot rely on the clock that is running at the client. Client side clocks drift, they can run in a different speed or even a malicious client modifies the clock on purpose. So instead of a normal timestamp, we have to use a Hybrid Logical Clock that takes a client generated id and the number of the clients query into account. Our timestamp will then look like 2021-10-04T15:29.40.273Z-0000-eede1195b7d94dd5. These timestamps can be brought into a deterministic order and each client can run the replicated queries in the same order. Watch this video to learn how to implement that.\nWhile this sounds easy and realizable, we have some problems:\nThis kind of replication works great when you replicate between multiple SQL servers. It does not work great when you replicate between a single server and many clients.\n\nAs mentioned above, clients can be offline for a long time which could require us to do many and heavy rollbacks on each client when someone comes back after a long time and replicates the change.\nWe have many clients where many changes can appear and our database would have to roll back many times.\nDuring the rollback, the database cannot be used for read queries.\nIt is required that each client downloads and keeps the whole query history.\n\nWith NoSQL, replication works different. A new client downloads all current documents and each time a document changes, that document is downloaded again. Instead of replicating the query that leads to a data change, we just replicate the changed data itself. Of course, we could do the same with SQL and just replicate the affected rows of a query, like WatermelonDB does it. This was a clever way to go for WatermelonDB, because it was initially made for React Native and did want to use the fast SQLite instead of the slow AsyncStorage. But in a more general view, it defeats the whole purpose of having a replicating relational database because you have transactions locally, but these transactions become meaningless as soon as the data goes through the replication layer.\n\n  \n\n\n\nServer side validation\nWhenever there is client-side input, it must be validated on the server.\nOn a NoSQL database, validating a changed document is trivial. The client sends the changed document to the server, and the server can then check if the user was allowed to modify that one document and if the applied changes are ok.\nSafely validating a SQL query is up to impossible.\n\nYou first need a way to parse the query with all this complex SQL syntax and keywords.\nYou have to ensure that the query does not DOS your system.\nThen you check which rows would be affected when running the query and if the user was allowed to change them\nThen you check if the mutation to that rows are valid.\n\nFor simple queries like an insert/update/delete to a single row, this might be doable. But a query with 4 LEFT JOIN will be hard.\nEvent optimization\nWith NoSQL databases, each write event always affects exactly one document. This makes it easy to optimize the processing of events at the client. For example instead of handling multiple updates to the same document, when the user comes online again, you could skip everything but the last event.\nSimilar to that you can optimize observable query results. When you query the customers table you get a query result of 10 customers. Now a new customer is added to the table and you want to know how the new query results look like. You could analyze the event and now you know that you only have to add the new customer to the previous results set, instead of running the whole query again. These types of optimizations can be run with all NoSQL queries and even work with limit and skip operators. In RxDB this all happens in the background with the EventReduce algorithm that calculates new query results on incoming changes.\nThese optimizations do not really work with relational data. A change to one table could affect a query to any other tables. and you could not just calculate the new results based on the event. You would always have to re-run the full query to get the updated results.\nMigration without relations\nSooner or later you change the layout of your data. You update the schema and you also have to migrate the stored rows/documents. In NoSQL this is often not a big deal because all of your documents are modeled as self containing piece of data. There is an old version of the document and you have a function that transforms it into the new version.\nWith relational data, nothing is self-contained. The relevant data for the migration of a single row could be inside any other table. So when changing the schema, it will be important which table to migrate first and how to orchestrate the migration or relations.\nEverything can be downgraded to NoSQL\nTo use an offline first database in the frontend, you have to make it compatible with your backend APIs.\nMaking software things compatible often means you have to find the lowest common denominator.\nWhen you have SQLite in the frontend and want to replicate it with the backend, the backend also has to use SQLite. You cannot even use PostgreSQL because it has a different SQL dialect and some queries might fail. But you do not want to let the frontend dictate which technologies to use in the backend just to make replication work.\nWith NoSQL, you just have documents and writes to these documents. You can build a document based layer on top of everything by removing functionality. It can be built on top of SQL, but also on top of a graph database or even on top of a key-value store like levelDB.\nWith that document layer you can build a replication API that serves documents sorted by the last update time and there you have a realtime replication.\nCaching query results\nMemory is limited and this is especially true for client side applications where you never know how much free RAM the device really has. You want to have a fast realtime UI, so your database must be able to cache query results.\nWhen you run a SQL query like SELECT .. the result of it can be anything. An array, a number, a string, a single row, it depends on how the query goes on. So the caching strategy can only be to keep the result in memory, once for each query.\nThis scales very bad because the more queries you run, the more results you have to store in memory.\nWhen you make a query to a NoSQL collection, you always know how the result will look like. It is a list of documents, based on the collection's schema (if you have one). The result set is stored in memory, but because you get similar documents for different queries to the same collection, we can de-duplicated the documents. So when multiple queries return the same document, we only have it in the cache once and each query caches point to the same memory object. So no matter how many queries you make, your cache maximum is the collection size.\nTypeScript support\nModern web apps are build with TypeScript and you want the transpiler to know the types of your query result so it can give you build time errors when something does not match. This is quite easy on document based systems. The typings of for each document of a collection can be generated from the schema, and all queries to that collection will always return the given document type. With SQL you have to manually write the typings for each query by hand because it can contain all these aggregate functions that affect the type of the query's result.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat you lose with NoSQL\n\nYou can not run relational queries across tables inside a single transaction.\nYou can not mutate documents based on a WHERE clause, in a single transaction.\nYou need to resolve replication conflicts on a per-document basis.\n\nBut there is database XY\nYes, there are SQL databases out there that run on the client side or have replication, but not both.\n\nWebSQL / sql.js: In the past there was WebSQL in the browser. It was a direct mapping to SQLite because all browsers used the SQLite implementation. You could store relational data in it, but there was no concept of replication at any point in time. sql.js is an SQLite complied to JavaScript. It has not replication and it has (for now) no persistent storage, everything is stored in memory.\nWatermelonDB is a SQL databases that runs in the client. WatermelonDB uses a document-based replication that is not able to replicate relational queries.\nCockroach / Spanner/ PostgreSQL etc. are SQL databases with replication. But they run on servers, not on clients, so they can make different trade offs.\n\nFurther read\n\nCockroach Labs: Living Without Atomic Clocks\nMake a PR to this file if you have more interesting links to that topic\n\n"},"questions-answers.html":{"url":"questions-answers.html","title":"Questions & Answers","keywords":"","body":"Questions and answers\nCan't change the schema\nWhen you make changes to the schema of a collection, you sometimes can get an error like\nError: addCollections(): another instance created this collection with a different schema.\nThis means you have created a collection before and added document-data to it.\nWhen you now just change the schema, it is likely that the new schema does not match the saved documents inside of the collection.\nThis would cause strange bugs and would be hard to debug, so RxDB check's if your schema has changed and throws an error.\nTo change the schema in production-mode, do the following\n\nIncrease the version by 1\nAdd the appropriate migrationStrategies so the saved data will be modified to match the new schema\n\nIn development-mode, the schema-change can be simplified by one of these strategies:\n\nUse the memory-adapter so your db resets on restart and your schema is not safed permanently\nCall removeRxDatabase('mydatabasename', 'adapter'); before creating a new RxDatabase-instance\nAdd a timestamp as suffix to the database-name to create a new one each run like name: 'heroesDB' + new Date().getTime()\n\n"},"contribute.html":{"url":"contribute.html","title":"Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Contribution\nWe are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.\nDeveloping\nRequirements\nBefore you can start developing, do the following:\n\nMake sure you have installed nodejs with version 7 or higher\nClone the repository git clone https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb.git\nInstall the dependencies cd rxdb && npm install\nMake sure that the tests work for you npm run test\n\nFlow\nWhile developing you should run npm run dev and leave it open in the console.
